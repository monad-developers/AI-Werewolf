## üîß Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If a port is already in use, modify the port number in the corresponding configuration file.

### AI API Failure
- Check API key settings in environment variables
- AI service will automatically downgrade to preset replies, which won't affect game progress

### Process Startup Failure
- Check the corresponding log file for detailed error information
- Ensure dependencies are properly installed: `pnpm install`
- Production mode requires building first: `pnpm build`

## üéØ Test Example

After startup, you can test the AI player's speaking function:

```bash
# Test Smart Analyst speech
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/player/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "otherSpeeches": ["player2: I think player3 is suspicious"],
    "allSpeeches": ["player1: Hello everyone", "player2: I think player3 is suspicious"]
  }'
```

Each AI player will generate different styles of responses based on their personality traits.
